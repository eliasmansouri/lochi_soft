# lochi_soft IoT Environmental Monitoring Hackathon Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to our lochi_soft IoT Environmental Monitoring project, developed during the XYZ Hackathon Challenge. This project aims to measure temperature and air humidity, providing valuable insights into the environmental conditions of a given space. Although energy consumption data integration was a challenge we couldn't conquer during the hackathon, we've laid the groundwork for easy integration in the future.

## Features

- Real-time temperature and air humidity monitoring.
- Responsive web interface developed using NextJS.
- Easy integration for future energy consumption data.
